# Sparking Curiosity: A Recap of Girls Math and Science Day!

March 1st was a day filled with excitement, discovery, and a whole lot of scientific wonder! I had the absolute pleasure of co-organizing Girls Math and Science Day (GMSD) alongside my incredible co-chairs, Jamily Lorena and Jamily Roberts, and it was truly an experience to remember.

Organized by the Graduate Women In Science Mid-Michigan Chapter, GMSD is an annual event dedicated to igniting a passion for STEM in young girls. We believe that every girl deserves the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of science, and GMSD provides a platform for them to do just that.

This year, we welcomed over a hundred enthusiastic young participants, eager to dive into hands-on activities and learn from the best! The energy in the room was palpable as girls worked side-by-side with our amazing team of scientists. We designed a variety of engaging demonstrations and activities, covering a broad spectrum of scientific fields. From chemistry experiments that sparked colorful reactions to biology explorations that revealed the wonders of the natural world, there was something to captivate every curious mind.

Seeing the girls' faces light up as they made their own discoveries was incredibly rewarding. Itâ€™s not just about teaching them scientific concepts; it's about showing them that science is fun, accessible, and a field where they absolutely belong. We aimed to create an environment where they could ask questions, experiment without fear, and truly experience the joy of scientific exploration.

The success of GMSD wouldn't have been possible without the dedication and passion of our volunteers. Their enthusiasm and expertise were instrumental in making the day so impactful. We are immensely grateful for their commitment to inspiring the next generation of female scientists.

I am incredibly proud to have been a part of such an amazing outreach initiative. Witnessing firsthand the impact we had on these young girls was truly inspiring. It reinforces the importance of providing opportunities for them to engage with science and empowers them to pursue their dreams.

GMSD is more than just a day of activities; it's an investment in the future. By fostering a love for science in young girls, we are paving the way for a more diverse and innovative scientific community. We hope that the experiences they had at GMSD will spark a lifelong curiosity and encourage them to pursue their passions in math and science.

Thank you to everyone who made Girls Math and Science Day 2025 such a resounding success! We look forward to another year of inspiring young minds.
